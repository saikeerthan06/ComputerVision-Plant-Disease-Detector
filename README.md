This Repository houses my Computer Vision Project, which was assigned to me in Year 2 Semester 2 of my AI & Data Engineering Polytechnic Course. 

Objectives: 
1. The objective of this project is to create a model, which is able to detect at least 10 different plant diseases classes, and an UI/App must be devised in order to house the model.

The UI files are: 
  1. Safeplant_cred.py
  2. extra_safeplant.py - Run this file with "Safeplant_cred.py" in the same working directory
  3. requirements.txt - is the requirements text which consists of all the packages needed to run the app.
  4. User Manual Word File - This user manual will bring you up to speed on how to utilise our application! 

As part of the project requirements, my team and I were asked to create two model and compare between the two model and justify as to why we chose the better model. The main model which we loaded into the application is a transfer
learning model built from MobileNetV3 Small. The other model which we built for comparison is MobileNetV2. 

We are naming our computer vision model - "Flora" which is powered by MobileNetV3 Small. 

"florav13.keras" is the official Flora Model file
